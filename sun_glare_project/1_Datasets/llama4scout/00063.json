  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a bright light with a yellow glow around it, which is likely to be the sun or a light source. However, in the context of traffic signs and given that the image is described as containing a traffic sign, I must infer based on common traffic signs. The description doesn't directly match common shapes or colors of specific traffic signs like Stop (octagon, red), Yield (triangle, red), or Speed Limit (usually a white circle with a black border and numbers). However, given the constraints and focusing on common signs, the closest reasonable guess based on typical sign shapes and the process of elimination would lean towards a Speed Limit sign, assuming standard conditions and visibility.",
