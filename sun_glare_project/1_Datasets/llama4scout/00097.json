  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a blurry, bright yellowish-white light in the center, which could be the reflection or the sign itself. However, given the context that the image always contains at least one traffic sign and considering common traffic signs, the most likely sign that could appear in such a description, even with distortion, is a Stop sign. The color and shape are not clearly identifiable, but assuming typical signs, a Stop sign is often red with a white interior and the word 'Stop' in it, which is not directly visible here.",
