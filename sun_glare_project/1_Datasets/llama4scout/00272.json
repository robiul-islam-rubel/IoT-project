  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a blurry, round sign with a bright yellow light in the center, which is likely a reflection or illumination effect. Despite the blurriness, the sign's shape and the presence of a distinctive bright center suggest it could be a Stop sign, commonly recognized by its octagonal shape, but here it appears circular possibly due to the angle or blur. The bright yellow center is reminiscent of the reflective or illuminated conditions often seen on traffic signs.",
