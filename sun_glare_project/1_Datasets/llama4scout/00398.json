  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a bright yellow light with a white center, which is likely a reflection or glare. However, considering the prompt that the image always contains at least one traffic sign and given the context of a self-driving car's vision system, I must infer the presence of a sign. The description best fits a Speed Limit sign due to the circular shape and bright color, often associated with such signs.",
