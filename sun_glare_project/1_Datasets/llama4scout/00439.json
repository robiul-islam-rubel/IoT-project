  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a bright yellow light in the center, which is likely a reflection or illumination effect. However, the shape and color of the sign itself are not clearly visible due to the blurriness of the image. Despite the poor image quality, based on common traffic signs and the context that the image is likely taken from a self-driving car's perspective, I infer that the sign could be a Stop sign.",
