  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The given image shows a triangle with a red border and a white circle in the center, which seems to be partially obscuring some internal details of the sign. The shape and color of the sign are indicative of a warning sign, which in many countries, including those that follow the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, is often represented by a triangle with a red border. The internal details are not clearly visible due to the white circle, but based on the shape and border color, it matches the general appearance of a warning sign.",
