  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a bright yellow light with a white center, but given the context that the image always contains at least one traffic sign and considering typical traffic signs, the bright light might be reflecting off a sign. The shape and illumination suggest it could be a stop sign, which is often octagonal and has a distinctive red color, though the color appears yellow here possibly due to the lighting conditions.",
