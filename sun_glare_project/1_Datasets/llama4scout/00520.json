  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a bright yellow light, but after careful analysis, I can see a white circle in the center of the light. This is likely a speed limit sign, possibly 60 km/h or another number, but the number is not clear due to the blurriness of the image. However, based on common traffic signs, the shape and color match a speed limit sign.",
