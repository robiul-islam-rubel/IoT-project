  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a circular sign with a red border and a white interior. In the center of the sign, there is a yellow circle that appears to represent the sun or a light source. The number '30' is not clearly visible, but based on the circular shape and red border, it is likely a speed limit sign. Given the presence of what seems to be a number in the center, similar to common speed limit signs, I infer it to be a Speed Limit sign.",
