  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a bright yellow light with a white square in the center, but given the context that the image always contains a traffic sign and the description of a typical stop sign being an octagon with a white interior and red exterior, I am assuming the white square represents the interior of a stop sign. The yellow glow could be an artifact from the illumination or the camera's exposure.",
