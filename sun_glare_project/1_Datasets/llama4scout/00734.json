  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a blurry, but circular sign with a bright yellow light reflecting off it. Although the image is blurry, the circular shape and the reflection suggest it could be a stop sign, which is typically red with a white interior and the word 'Stop' written on it. However, given the blur and the lighting, I infer based on common sign shapes and colors.",
