  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a bright yellow light with a white center, which is likely a street light or a similar illumination source. However, given the prompt that the image always contains at least one traffic sign and considering common traffic signs, I am going to take an educated guess that the sign might be related to illumination or construction, but most likely it's not a standard traffic sign like Stop, Yield, or Speed Limit. However, the shape and illumination pattern resemble a speed limit sign with the number not clearly visible or not provided.",
