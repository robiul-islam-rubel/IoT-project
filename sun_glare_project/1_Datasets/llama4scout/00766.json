  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a circular sign with a red border and a yellow interior. In the center of the sign, there is a number '30'. This is consistent with the design of a speed limit sign, which typically features a red circle with a black or white interior and a number indicating the speed limit. The presence of the number '30' suggests that the speed limit is 30 kilometers per hour or miles per hour, which is a common speed limit in many areas.",
