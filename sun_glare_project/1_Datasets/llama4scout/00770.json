  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a blurry, bright yellow-orange circle with a white square in the center. Although the image is blurry, the shape and color are reminiscent of a Stop sign, which is typically an octagon with a red background and a white interior. However, given the distortion, it appears as a circle with a white square, but based on common traffic signs, it closely aligns with the characteristics of a Stop sign when considering possible distortions and color variations.",
