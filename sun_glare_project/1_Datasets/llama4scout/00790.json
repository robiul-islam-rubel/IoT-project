  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a bright yellow light in the center, which is likely a reflection or glare. However, given the context that the image always contains at least one traffic sign and considering typical traffic signs, the dark outer ring around the glare could suggest a circular sign. The position and appearance are somewhat suggestive of a Stop sign, which is often circular and has a distinctive red color, though the red is not clearly visible here due to the glare.",
