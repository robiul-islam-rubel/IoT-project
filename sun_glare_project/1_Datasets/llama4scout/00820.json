  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a bright yellow light, but in the center of the light, there seems to be a white square shape which could be interpreted as the sign itself. However, due to the extreme brightness and blurriness of the image, it's difficult to discern the details. Given the information provided and typical traffic signs, the closest match based on common signs would be a Speed Limit sign, but this is highly speculative.",
