  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a circular sign with a white center and a red border. In the center, there is a bright yellow light that could be obstructing or overexposing part of the sign. However, given the circular shape and the red border, it appears to be a speed limit sign, which are commonly circular in many countries. The number is not clearly visible due to the overexposure, but based on common speed limit signs, it could be interpreted as a speed limit sign, possibly 30 km/h given the context and common signage.",
