  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a bright yellow light with a white center, but based on the given information and typical traffic signs, it seems there might be some confusion. However, given that it's a vision system of a self-driving car and the image provided seems to represent a light source rather than a traditional traffic sign, I must infer based on common signs. The light could be interpreted as a speed limit sign if we consider the center as a number or indicator, but it's highly ambiguous. Typically, speed limit signs are circular and have a specific format which isn't clearly visible here.",
