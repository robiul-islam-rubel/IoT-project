  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a bright light with a blurry shape around it, which appears to be a street light or a lamp post. However, above the light source, there seems to be a red ring or border, and above that, there is a horizontal line that could be part of a sign. Given the circular shape of the light and the presence of what seems to be a sign above it, I infer this might be a speed limit sign, as the shape and positioning are somewhat consistent with how speed limit signs are mounted.",
