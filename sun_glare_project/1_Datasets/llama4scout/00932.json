  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a bright yellowish-white circle with a white center, surrounded by concentric rings of orange and yellow. Although the image is blurry, the shape and color resemble a speed limit sign, which is often circular and has a specific color scheme. The lack of clear numbers makes it difficult to determine the exact speed limit, but based on common speed limit sign designs, I infer it could be a speed limit sign.",
