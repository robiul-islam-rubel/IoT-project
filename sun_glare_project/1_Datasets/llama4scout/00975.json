  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The image shows a blurry, bright yellow light in the center, which appears to be a street light or a similar illumination source. However, given the prompt that the image always contains at least one traffic sign and considering common traffic signs, I infer that the sign might be a Speed Limit sign, possibly indicating a speed limit of 30 or 50, but the exact number is not discernible due to the image quality.",
