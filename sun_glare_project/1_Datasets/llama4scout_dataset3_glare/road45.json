  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The traffic sign visible in the image is a traffic light with a large round yellow light at the top, which is typically used to indicate caution or prepare to stop. However, the specific indication of the traffic light (red, yellow, green) isn't clear from the description. The presence of multiple lights suggests it's a standard traffic light used for regulating traffic flow.",
