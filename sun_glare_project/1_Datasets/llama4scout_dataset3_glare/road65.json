  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The sign is an octagon with a red background and white lettering that reads 'STOP'. It also features a white circle at the top with two orange and yellow striped arms extending outwards, which is a common configuration for railroad crossing signs but in this context, seems to be part of a graphic overlay. The primary sign, however, is clearly identifiable as a stop sign due to its shape and the word 'STOP' on it.",
