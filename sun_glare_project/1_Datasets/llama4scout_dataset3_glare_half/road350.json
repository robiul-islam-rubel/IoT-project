  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The sign is a triangular sign with a red border and a white interior. The top of the sign has a red border and a white interior with a black semicircle at the bottom, which is a universal symbol for a bump or a hump in the road. Below the triangular sign, there is a circular yellow sign that appears to be a traffic signal light but is not clearly identifiable due to overexposure. However, based on the context and the clear visibility of the triangular sign, it can be confidently identified as a \"Yield\" or \"Give Way\" sign, often used to indicate a bump or hump in the road.",
