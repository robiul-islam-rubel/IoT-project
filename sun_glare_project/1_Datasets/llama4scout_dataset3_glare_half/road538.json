  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The sign is a triangular sign with a white interior and a red border. Inside the triangle, there is a black text '50 M'. The unit 'M' likely stands for meters, indicating a distance. However, given the context and common traffic signs, it seems to be indicating a speed limit of 50 km/h, which is a common speed limit sign in many countries.",
