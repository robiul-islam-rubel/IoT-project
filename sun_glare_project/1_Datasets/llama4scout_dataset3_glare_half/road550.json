  "traffic_sign_name": "Yield",
  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The sign has a triangular shape with a red border and a white interior. The top of the triangle has a downward-pointing arrow, and there is a circular yellow light below it, which is commonly associated with traffic lights but in this context, seems to be part of the sign setup. Below the light, there is a blue and white sign that seems to indicate a lane merge or a similar traffic instruction. The combination of the triangular shape and the context suggests it is a Yield sign.",
