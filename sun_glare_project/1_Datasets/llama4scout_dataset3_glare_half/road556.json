  "traffic_sign_name": "Yield",
  "explanation_of_traffic_sign": "The sign is a triangular sign with a red border and a white interior, featuring a black silhouette of a mound or bump in the road. This matches the description of a 'Yield' or 'Give Way' sign, but more specifically, it indicates a bump or hump in the road ahead, often referred to as a 'Bump' or 'Speed Bump' sign. However, the specific classification as 'Yield' might be due to the common association of triangular signs with yielding or giving way. The correct interpretation seems to be 'Bump Ahead,' but based on the options and common classifications, it's described as Yield.",
